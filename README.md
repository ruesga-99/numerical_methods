# Numerical Methods 

In this repository, you will find Python implementations of commonly used numerical methods. These algorithms are useful for solving a wide range of mathematical problems, including linear algebra, optimization, interpolation, and differential equations. This repository is an active personal project, therefore new numerical methods will be soon uploaded.

## Emoji Key
✅ (Completed): This emoji is used to mark tasks that have been finished and require no further work.

📆 (Planned): This emoji is used for tasks that are planned for the future, indicating they are on the work calendar. The corresponding file does not exist within the repository.

🚧 (Under Construction): This emoji indicates tasks that have been implemented but still need further improvements or adjustments. There is already a corresponding file within the repository but hasn't been fully developed.

💡 (Planning Ongoing): This emoji is used for sections that haven't been completely defined on their components. 

## Usage
To use these numerical methods, simply clone the repository and import the desired method into your Python environment. Each method is contained in its own module for easy integration into your projects.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a numerical method in Python that you would like to share, please feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions will help make this repository a valuable resource for the community. Different aproaches to an already submitted numerical method just as more efficient algorithms are also apreciated.
