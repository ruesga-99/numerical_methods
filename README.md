# Numerical Methods 

In this repository, you will find Python implementations of commonly used numerical methods. These algorithms are useful for solving a wide range of mathematical problems, including linear algebra, optimization, interpolation, and differential equations. This repository is an active personal project, therefore new numerical methods will be soon uploaded.
